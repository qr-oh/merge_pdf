## Offline GUI for PDF merger
---

Just a simple PDF merger added with GUI for convenience in selecting files.  
   
  
To use it for the first time, run in command line:  
>pip -r requirements.txt
  
  NOTE: Files have to be named in alphabetical order for the merge to be done properly. 

Do let me know how it can be improved! :)
